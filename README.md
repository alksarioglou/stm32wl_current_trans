# Interface of an STM32WL microcontroller with an AC current transformer sensor

Interface an STM32WL microcontroller with an AC current transformer sensor (YHDC SCT006) to measure power consumption of a washing machine and dryer “non-invasively”

Sample with ADC -> Convert to corresponding voltage -> Calculate RMS value with Newton-Raphson method
